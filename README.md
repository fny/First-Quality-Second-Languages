Around [June 8, 2008][fqsl-2008], this website was originally developed using PHP by [GarboWeb](http://garboweb.com) for [Dr. Rosalyn Secor][facebook-secor]. After some hosting shenanigans <time datetime="2010-06-09">[two years later][fqsl-2010]</time>, I recovered the site from a cached version and have hosted the site for her ever since.
